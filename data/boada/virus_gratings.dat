;; This is a wavelength-calibration setup file for p3d and the Mitchell Spectrograph
;;   [the instrument was formerly named VIRUS-P].

;; Format: This file is, eventually, used by p3d_wavecal_dispmask_gui. The data header
;;         grating name/detector is given in the first column. The corresponding data
;;         initial and final wavelengths are given in the second and third columns. All
;;         lines preceeded with a semicolon (;) are interpreted as comments. The columns
;;         must be separated by white space (only). This file is parsed using the NASA
;;         astro-lib routine READCOL.
;;
;; Note! Please, do not edit this file unless you know what you are doing.
;;
;; Tip:  Do you want to use p3d with another wavelength range than the default one that is
;;       specified here? If your answer is yes then the easiest way is to copy this file
;;       to your data reduction directory. Edit the copied file to fit your wavelength
;;       range, and thereafter set the 'gratingsfile_dm' parameter in your user-parameter
;;       file to the full filename (including the path) of the copied file.
;;
;;       The reason to why you have to do this manually is that the grating angle of
;;       VIRUS-P is set manually. The data headers consequently do not contain the
;;       required information to calculate a wavelength range.
