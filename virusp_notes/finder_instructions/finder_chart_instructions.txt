The finding chart code is interactive.  Given coordinates, it should bring up a sky image with the VP IFU and guider cam overlaid.  You can click and drag the VP position to a different spot if desired (galaxies should be exactly centered, sky positions should have the IFU over a relatively blank piece of sky).  Then press Enter (or whatever on-screen prompt is given) and the program will finish.  At the end you'll have a lot of windows you can close.

Each of the lines below will create a set of finder charts for one field.  These are the positions you want to have ready for the beginning of our run (in addition to the finder charts I attached in my e-mail).  You might be able to run them all as a single script (interrupted each time to interact with the sky image), or enter them one by one.

Run these from /finder_code/scripts/:

./find_gen.csh 01:07:24.90 32:24:45.0 NGC383
./find_gen.csh 01:07:14.60 32:13:42.7 NGC383sky
./find_gen.csh 04:35:04.00 73:15:45.0 NGC1573
./find_gen.csh 04:35:37.33 73:07:11.5 NGC1573sky
./find_gen.csh 23:15:44.50 -02:22:53.0 NGC7556
./find_gen.csh 23:15:53.30 -02:30:57.8 NGC7556sky
./find_gen.csh 09:32:52.90 67:37:03.0 NGC2892
./find_gen.csh 09:33:28.22 67:28:51.0 NGC2892sky
./find_gen.csh 21:51:11.02 28:51:50.4 BD28_4211


The finder chart images are written to /finder_code/images/ .

For each position, there are three output images, e.g.,
NGC383_field.ps
NGC383_guider.ps
NGC383_tot.ps

and
NGC383sky_field.ps
NGC383sky_guider.ps
NGC383sky_tot.ps

_field.ps  shows where the VIRUS-P fibers fall on the target field (for one subdither position)
_guider.ps  shows the guider field and the (X,Y) positions of stars on the guider camera
_tot.ps  is a wide-field view of the IFU and guider fields


To successfully observe a galaxy, you'll need to take the _guider.ps finding chart, identify one bright star in the field of view, and enter its (X,Y) positions into a text file, MASSIVE_Dec2014.fiducial .  Circle this object on the finding chart so you can verify it is being auto-guided in the proper location during observations.  If possible, avoid stars near the very edges of the guider field, or stars with nearby companions.

Do the same for the sky positions, just to ensure that the telescope doesn't drift and run background stars over multiple fibers.


Save or upload MASSIVE_Dec2014.fiducial somewhere on atlas, so you can retrieve it when you are ready for autoguiding (see step 14d in instructions.txt).
